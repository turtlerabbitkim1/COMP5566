/**
 * @dev These functions deal with verification of Merkle Tree proofs.
 *
 * The tree and the proofs can be generated using our
 * https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/merkle-tree[JavaScript library].
 * You will find a quickstart guide in the readme.
 *
 * WARNING: You should avoid using leaf values that are 64 bytes long prior to
 * hashing, or use a hash function other than keccak256 for hashing leaves.
 * This is because the concatenation of a sorted pair of internal nodes in
 * the Merkle tree could be reinterpreted as a leaf value.
 * OpenZeppelin's JavaScript library generates Merkle trees that are safe
 * against this attack out of the box.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Consider memory side-effects when using custom hashing functions
 * that access memory in an unsafe way.
 *
 * NOTE: This library supports proof verification for merkle trees built using
 * custom _commutative_ hashing functions (i.e. `H(a, b) == H(b, a)`). Proving
 * leaf inclusion in trees built using non-commutative hashing functions requires
 * additional logic that is not supported by this library.

     * tree (i.e., as seen from right to left starting at the deepest layer and continuing at the next layer).
     *
     * NOTE: The _empty set_ (i.e. the case where `proof.length == 1 && leaves.length == 0`) is considered a no-op,
     * and therefore a valid multiproof (i.e. it returns `proof[0]`). Consider disallowing this case if you're not
     * validating the leaves elsewhere.
